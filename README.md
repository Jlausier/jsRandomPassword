# jsRandomPassword

## Description
This project had me, work through making the javascript  for a random password generator contain different arrays in js. 
This really challenged and gave me a good basic understanding of javascript, by labelinmg variables, accesing arrays in a function, getting prompt messages, getting alert messages, as well as getting a for loop to randomize my array given.
